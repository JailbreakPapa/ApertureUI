ApertureUI is a HTML/CSS/JS UI Toolkit for video-games, real-time graphics applications and more.

Utilizing a light-weight framework, extensible, plugin based system, that allows modularity, and minimal thirdparty dependency's, it can be used in many applications, where performance must stay a high priority!

In-fact, Aperture UI is used in the Zen Family of Consoles for all of its UI.

The toolkit aims to be a open-source option for other Web-based UI Toolkits, like Coherent GameFace.
