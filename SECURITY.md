# Project Security Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to the Security Policy of Aperture UI. Please note that this project is currently under active development, and as such, the security practices, protocols, and features are continuously evolving. This document outlines the current approach to security, but changes are expected as the project matures.

## Development Status
Aperture UI is in its development phase. This means:

New features and updates are being regularly added.
Security practices and procedures are still being established and refined.
Code and dependencies are frequently changing, which may introduce new vulnerabilities.
We encourage users and contributors to stay informed about updates and to report any security concerns promptly.

## Security Principles
During this phase, Aperture UI is committed to the following security principles:

Transparency: We aim to keep our community informed about security decisions and vulnerabilities.
Proactive Security: We are actively working to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
User Awareness: We encourage users to be aware of the risks associated with using software in development.
Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability or have concerns about the security of Aperture UI, please contact us immediately. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose issues, allowing us to address them before they can be exploited.

Contact Email: [security@wdstudios.tech or contact@wdstudios.tech]
PGP Key: [Link to PGP key if applicable]
Issue Tracker: [Link to issue tracker, if public disclosure is appropriate]
Please include as much detail as possible when reporting an issue, including:

Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
Potential impact of the vulnerability.
Any known exploits.
## Current Security Practices
Given that Aperture UI is still in development, the following security practices are in place:

Regular Code Reviews: Code changes are regularly reviewed for potential security issues.
Dependency Management: We monitor and update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
Testing: We are implementing automated testing to detect security flaws early in the development cycle.
Access Control: Limited access to sensitive areas of the project is enforced to minimize risks.
Known Vulnerabilities
As the project is still evolving, there may be known vulnerabilities that have not yet been addressed. These will be documented here along with any available mitigations.

**NONE AS OF 02.09.2024**

## Future Plans
As Aperture UI progresses towards a stable release, we plan to:

Implement comprehensive security audits.
Establish a formal incident response plan.
Enhance user and developer security documentation.

Disclaimer
Aperture UI is provided "as is" during the development phase. While we strive to address security concerns promptly, users should be aware that using development software carries inherent risks.

## Conclusion
Thank you for your interest in the security of Aperture UI. We value the contributions of our community in making the project more secure. Please stay tuned for updates and help us build a safer product.
